## ðŸ“Œ About
Developed a Box Office app using react. The app comes with theme implementation - Light mode and Dark mode. You can search for shows as well as actors. The app uses an API to fetch the data for the content. The navigation panel contains 2 links - Shows and Starred. All the shows that you star will go to the Starred section. Even if you close the browser, you can view your starred shows the next time you open it. You can also view information page for a particular show which contains image, title, summary, details, seasons, and cast.
